Generating a Certificate Signing Request (CSR) using Apache mod_ssl/OpenSSL
A CSR is a file containing your certificate application information, including your Public Key.
Generate your CSR and then copy and paste the CSR file into the webform in the enrollment process:

Generate keys and certificate:
To generate a pair of private key and public Certificate Signing Request (CSR) for a webserver, "server", use the
following command :


openssl req -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout myserver.key -out server.csr

This creates a two files. The file myserver.key contains a private key; do not disclose this file to anyone.
Carefully protect the private key.
In particular, be sure to backup the private key, as there is no means to recover it should it be lost.
The private key is used as input in the command to generate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
You will now be asked to enter details to be entered into your CSR.
What you are about to enter is what is called a Distinguished Name or a DN. 
For some fields there will be a default value, If you enter '.', the field will be left blank.

Enter the following 'extra' attributes to be sent with your certificate request

If the domain name (Common Name) is mydomain.com append the domain to the hostname (use the fully qualified domain name).

Your CSR will now have been created. Open the server.csr in a text editor and copy and paste the contents into the
online enrollment form when requested.

If the "-nodes" is inputted the key will not be encrypted with a DES pass phrase.
